We collect plenty of data, and you’ll join our dedicated data science team to work on crunching it.

If you bring your clear-thinking mind, and focus on practical applications of data to help us, our world class team will give you the freedom, resources and support you need to make a difference.</p> <p>\\xa0</p> <p><strong>It takes a special kind of human…</strong></p> <p>You understand that information is power, and you’re keen to help get more usable information into the hands of decision makers. \\xa0You think it matters that people have the right information, and you get a kick out of seeing the difference it can make when you get it into the right hands. You may be relatively inexperienced or you may be an experienced pro, but you’re an imaginative and strategic thinker. Your mind is sharp, and you are keen to keep improving how you apply it. \\xa0</p> <p>You care about the accuracy of the information you provide, and you take care to ensure it’s right. \\xa0If a request is unclear, you’ll clarify it before getting stuck in. If you get asked for something that’s not the most practical, you’ll focus on understanding the problem so that you can help to come up with a better way. \\xa0You love spotting patterns and joining dots.

This 4-year post-doctoral position, funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, aims to address the large variability in speech understanding experienced by adult cochlear implant users. This variability is not understood well and may have multiple peripheral and central causes. In spite of this variability, cochlear implant sound processors are usually programmed in a default way. The first phase of the project will develop diagnostic tests (using psychophysical and fNIRS brain imaging techniques) in new implant users to assess peripheral and central limitations that affect how they develop speech understanding with device use. The second phase will evaluate techniques to overcome the limitations found in the diagnostic tests. These techniques, chosen individually for each implant user, may include changing the programming or signal processing in the sound processor or carrying out targeted auditory training.</p> <p>You will be joining a team that includes neuroscientists, clinicians, postgraduate students and engineers.
